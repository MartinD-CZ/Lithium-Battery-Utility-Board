CHANGELOG: 1.1 TO 1.2
=====================
new: D+ and D- pins now wired to a 3 pin connector
update: shield and ID pins of USB grounded
update: TP4056 status LEDs have only 1 resistor
update: TP4056 - removed Vcc resistor
new: added 2,2 mm mounting holes (for M2 screws)
update: dimensions matched to 18650 cell (18 x 60 mm - it is a little bit shorter, to allow 8 of them to be placed on a 100 x 100 PCB)
update: thermal pad beneath the TP4056

CHANGELOG: 1.0 TO 1.1
=====================
update: moved switch after load sharing circuit
update: changed the package of all resitors
new: added battery protected output
new: added some notes to the schematics
update: minor schematics tweaks, major PCB rework (thicker and shorter traces, less vias (36 vs 20) and all SMPS components are closer together)

CHANGELOG: 1.0
